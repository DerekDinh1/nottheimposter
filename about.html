					<p><span class="about-p">For the Impostr</span> is a community for those who want to find their voice. To speak up when they're unsure. Although many people do not realize it, everyone experiences imposter syndrome in some facet or another. The less experience in a field or topic, the less likely someone will question what they don't know.
					</p>
					<p>Imposter syndrome can be seen in many graduates without little to no experience in their field or even getting a job. Questioning their superiors can seem daunting but it's an important part of learning on the job. There could also be times someone doesn't want to ask about their relationship or advice on something of the like.
					</p>
					<p>Feel free to ask for advice, discuss difficult topics, and share ideas! Let's create a more open and collaborative space.
